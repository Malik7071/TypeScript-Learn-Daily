# Day 05 - TypeScript Generics

## Overview
On Day 05, I explored generics in TypeScript. Generics allow us to create components (like functions and classes) that can work with different types while still maintaining type safety. This makes code more flexible and reusable.

## What I Learned
- Creating generic functions and classes
- Using type parameters to enforce type constraints
- Applying generics to functions, interfaces, and classes

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use generics in TypeScript.
