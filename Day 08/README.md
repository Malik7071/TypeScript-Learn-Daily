# Day 08 - Decorators in TypeScript

## Overview
On Day 08, I explored decorators in TypeScript. Decorators are a powerful feature that can be used to modify the behavior of classes, methods, accessors, properties, and parameters. They are often used in frameworks like Angular to add metadata to classes and methods.

## What I Learned
- **Class Decorators**: Used to modify or annotate a class declaration.
- **Method Decorators**: Used to modify or annotate a method of a class.
- **Accessor Decorators**: Used to modify or annotate an accessor of a class.
- **Property Decorators**: Used to modify or annotate a property of a class.
- **Parameter Decorators**: Used to modify or annotate parameters of a class method.

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use various types of decorators in TypeScript.
