# Day 10 - TypeScript Modules and Namespaces

## Overview
On Day 10, I explored TypeScript Modules and Namespaces. Modules are used to organize code into self-contained blocks, while namespaces allow you to group related code under a single name to avoid naming conflicts and keep your code clean and manageable.

## What I Learned
- **Modules**: Help to break down code into reusable components, and can be imported and exported between files.
- **Namespaces**: Allow grouping of related functions, classes, interfaces, etc., under a single name.
- **Import and Export Syntax**: How to import and export modules in TypeScript.
- **Use Cases**: Practical scenarios where modules and namespaces can be used for better code organization.

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use modules and namespaces in TypeScript.
