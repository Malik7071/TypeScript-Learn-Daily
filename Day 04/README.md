# Day 04 - TypeScript Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## Overview
On Day 04, I explored TypeScript inheritance and abstract classes. I learned how to create base classes, extend them, and define abstract classes with abstract methods.

## What I Learned
- Creating base (parent) classes and extending them in child classes
- Using the `super` keyword to access the parent class's constructor and methods
- Defining and implementing abstract classes and methods

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates inheritance and abstract classes in TypeScript.
