# Day 09 - TypeScript Enums and Advanced Enum Usage

## Overview
On Day 09, I explored TypeScript Enums, a feature that provides a way to define a set of named constants. Enums in TypeScript can be numeric or string-based, and they are useful for creating readable and maintainable code by grouping related values together.

## What I Learned
- **Numeric Enums**: Enums where values are auto-incremented numbers.
- **String Enums**: Enums where each value is a string.
- **Heterogeneous Enums**: Enums containing both numeric and string values.
- **Computed and Constant Members**: How to define computed members in enums.
- **Reverse Mapping**: Accessing enum values and names.
- **Use Cases**: How enums can be used in practical scenarios like status codes or roles.

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use various types of enums in TypeScript.
