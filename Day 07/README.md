# Day 07 - Advanced Types in TypeScript

## Overview
On Day 07, I delved into advanced type features in TypeScript, including union types, intersection types, type aliases, and type guards. These features allow for more expressive and flexible type definitions, helping to create robust and maintainable code.

## What I Learned
- **Union Types**: Allow a variable to hold values of different types.
- **Intersection Types**: Combine multiple types into one.
- **Type Aliases**: Create new names for existing types.
- **Type Guards**: Use runtime checks to narrow down the type within a union type.

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use these advanced types in TypeScript.
