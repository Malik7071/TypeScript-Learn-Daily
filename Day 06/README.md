# Day 06 - TypeScript Modules and Namespaces

## Overview
On Day 06, I explored how to organize code in TypeScript using Modules and Namespaces. Both features help in structuring larger applications by grouping related code together. Modules follow the ES6 module syntax, while Namespaces (previously known as internal modules) are specific to TypeScript.

## What I Learned
- The difference between Modules and Namespaces
- How to create and import/export modules
- How to use namespaces to organize code
- Best practices for using modules and namespaces in TypeScript

## Code Example
The following code demonstrates how to use modules and namespaces in TypeScript.
